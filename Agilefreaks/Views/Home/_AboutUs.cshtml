                            We are a small software development studio located in Sibiu, Romania. We started this in 2010 as a two-men company and went through a steady progress since then with both enlarging our team and keeping our clients happy with the work we’ve done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We value a good atmosphere in the office! To achieve it we choose our team members with great care. This means that all the existing colleagues have a word to say when enlarging the team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our goal is to have a team with self-driven, highly motivated people that find good friends in each other. Experience tells us that everything will fall into place from there.

                            <p>AgileFreaks was born out of ambition. Before this, we worked on bigger companies. The problem there was that they were making compromises to the people they hired and the quality of work they delivered. We grew tired of this and set out with the mindset of 'no compromise' and people say we're on the good track.</p>

                <p>Since then in the last 8 years I've worked on a couple of national and international companies and in 2010 I've founded my own outsourcing studio.</p>

                <p>Since I was little I was fascinated with computers and I knew my life is going to revolve around them.
                Tried different (weird) jobs in my past: desktop publisher, IT specialist, embedded software engineer.</p>
                <p>I gave up working in big corporations in 2010 when I co-founded AgileFreaks and don't regret it one bit.</p>
                <p>I think of myself as an optimistic, quiet and self driven person that enjoys the simple things in life.</p>

                <p>
                    I am first and foremost a science/technology enthusiast and have been since I read my first science-fiction book, so when I got my first computer I instantly knew that 
                    I wanted to be a programmer (even though I didn't actually understood what it meant).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that in mind I went on to take courses at schools specialized in teaching programming/technology and finally got to start working as a programmer in 2009.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an initial first year in which I tried to find my place in bigger companies I realized that the best fit for me was a smaller but highly passionate team (Agile Freaks) 
                    where I've been working since 2011.
